By the end, you\u2019ll understand not just what it does, but why it\u2019s exciting. We\u2019ll cover the basic components, how a request flows from an AI model to a tool, and why this standardization could be a game-changer for developers and users alike.</p> <p>Learn more about me here, or dive straight into the presentation and use case example.</p>"},{"location":"about-me/","title":"About me","text":"The joys of bug-solving <p>Hi!
