Since Claude [announced the inception of Model Context Protocol (MCP) in November 2024](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol), thereâ€™s been a lot of buzz in the AI and developer communities.

Today, Iâ€™ll attempt to explain MCP in simple terms, so that by the end, youâ€™ll understand not just what it does, but why itâ€™s exciting. Weâ€™ll cover the basic components, how a request flows from an AI model to a tool, and why this standardization could be a game-changer for developers and users alike.
