It showcases technical writing best practices using **MkDocs** and **GitHub Pages** for deployment.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

The demo site presents rewritten and polished training material for two example features of a Digital Asset Management (DAM) system:

- **Auto Metadata Mapping** â€“ how metadata is automatically applied to uploaded assets.  
- **Workflow Automation** â€“ how the system triggers automated tasks when metadata is updated.

Each page demonstrates clear structure, concise explanations, and consistent tone â€” modeled after internal training documentation.
